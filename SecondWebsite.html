		<center><table width="50%" style="border: 2px solid Black;">
				<th>
				<ol>
				<li> This is my most favorite game because I played it a lot when I was younger and it was the most fun game. Modern Warfare 2 is especially at the top of the list because it is still fun if you played it today. </li>
				<li> Battlefront II is my most favorite Star Wars game and its game mechanics were ahead of its time. Along with its fun gameplay, my large interest in the Star Wars Universe as a child engaged me even further into the game.  </li>
				<li> My first and favorite Halo, the armor customization and polished design attracted my attention when I first played. The arcade gameplay of its multiplayer mixed with the compelling story made it the best of its time. </li>
				<li> As much criticism that the game received in its initial release, Destiny was a very addictive game that I enjoyed playing with friends. The combination of MMORPG mechanics and its smooth gameplay outweighed the lack of story.  </li>
				<li> Cyberpunk 2077, although not released, is a game I am very anticipated for. It is being developed by the team that made the Witcher 3, which was also highly praised. After watching the teaser for the game I am excited after seeing its setting and excellent graphics.  </li>
				<li> Overwatch barely made this list because of recent additions to the game, but the game was extremely fun for its first few years earning it a spot on the list.  </li>
