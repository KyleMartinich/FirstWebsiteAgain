	<h2> Background on my experience and why I selected these games </h2>
	<table  width="100%" style="border: 2px solid Black; background-color: rgb(170,210,255);"><th><p style="color:blue;">  My favorite video games span across multiple platforms over many different years. Modern Warfare 2 and Halo Reach are played on the Xbox 360, Destiny is played on the Xbox One, Battlefront II is played on the PlayStation 2, Overwatch is played on PC, and Cyberpunk is not released yet but will be played on PC. My favorite genre of games is obviously first person shooters but I still enjoy other genres of games. I still play Modern Warfare 2 and Halo Reach because they are backwards compatible for the Xbox One, I sometimes get on Overwatch, but I have not played Battlefront II or Destiny recently. These games are not only fun but they also have interesting settings such as Halo Reach's and Destiny's futuristic setting or Battlefront II's Star Wars Universe. Cyberpunk 2077, although I haven't played, is my favorite type of science-fiction setting because it is like a dystopian future hidden by really cool technology and I highly anticipate playing it after watching its teaser.   </p></th></table>
